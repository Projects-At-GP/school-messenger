# School Messenger
This is a messenger for school, which can be used in the network from school.

## And What Is It?
It's supposed to be a small messenger which can be accessed by the servers REST-API.

The idea behind this project is to bring people together who like programming and give them a place to talk.
Everyone can access it, but they should know how to code (otherwise it means they "stole" client-code 😉).

---
The BE (**B**ack**E**nd) is written in Python3 and the FE (**F**ront**E**nd) is up to you 😀.
All endpoints and specifications can be found in the [Specification](#Specification).

# Specification
The specification can be looked up in the [WhitePaper](WHITEPAPER.md).


# Note:
The server 'll be rewritten in a separate branch to be asynchronous to improve speed.
