## Connection
You can connect by just calling the ˝REST˝full-API.
The HOST and PORT must be provided by the host, but by default you can use the PORT `3333`.
> Note: at the moment the connection goes over **`HTTP`** and *not* `HTTPS`

### Versions
The API is split into versions to keep "old" clients running, even if the structure of the response ect have changed.

#### v0
`v0` has all here listed endpoints in the way they're mentioned.
> Note: This version has default responses because it isn't connected to a database. But it still checks all data!

#### v1
`v1` is the first version and even with `v0`, but is connected to a database and can be used for communication.

#### v2
`v2` is like `v1`, but *all keys in (json-) response* are ***lowercase***.

## Header
The header *must* contain `Authorization` and `User-Agent` on every request.
> **These Headers must always be added to the examples here!**

Example:
```yml
Authorization:  User <YOUR TOKEN>
User-Agent:     SchoolMessengerExamples Python3.9
```

## Account
### Account Info
You can gain information about accounts by using the `users/info`-endpoint.
> Versions: `v0`, `v1`, `v2`
```yml
GET users/info
Query:          <USER NAME OR USER ID>
```
If you want to know who you are (have only your token from [here](#get-token)) you can use the `users/whoami`-endpoint.
> Versions: `v0`, `v1`, `v2`
```yml
GET users/whoami
```
All of these examples have the following response:

> Versions: `v0`, `v1`, `v2`

> Status: 200
```json
{
  "name": "<USER NAME>",
  "id": "<USER ID>"
}
```

### Create Account
You have to create an account to get an access token to use the messenger.
> Versions: `v0`, `v1`, `v2`
```yml
POST users/registration
Name:           <YOUR NAME>
Password:       <YOUR PASSWORD>
```
> **Here is *no `Authorization`* needed!**

> **NOTE: `name` can't be numeric-only and must contain at least one letter!**

> Versions: `v0`, `v1`, `v2`

> Status: 201
```json
{
  "Token": "<TOKEN>"
}
```

> Versions: `v2`

> Status: 201
```json
{
  "token": "<TOKEN>"
}
```

### Delete Account
Deletes your account.
**THIS ACTION CANNOT MAKE UNDONE!!!**
> Versions: `v0`, `v1`, `v2`
```yml
DELETE users/registration
Password:       <YOUR PASSWORD>
```

> Status: 204


## Get Token
Of course, you need an access token for the `Authorization`.
There two ways to get the token:
1. by [Registration](#create-account) you can read it from the response or
2. by using the `users/me/token`-endpoint:
> Versions: `v0`, `v1`, `v2`
```yml
GET users/me/token
Name:           <YOUR NAME>
Password:       <YOUR PASSWORD>
```
> **Here is *no `Authorization`* needed!**

> Versions: `v0`, `v1`

> Status: 200
```json
{
  "Token": "<TOKEN>"
}
```

> Versions: `v2`

> Status: 200
```json
{
  "token": "<TOKEN>"
}
```

**Recommendation: you can store the token after registration ;)**

## Messages
### Send Messages
You can send messages by using the `messages`-endpoint.
> Versions: `v0`, `v1`, `v2`
```yml
POST messages
Content:        Hello World!
```

> Versions: `v0`, `v1`, `v2`

> Status: 201
```json
{
  "id": "<MESSAGE ID>"
}
```

### Fetch Messages
You can fetch messages by using the `messages`-endpoint.
> Versions: `v0`, `v1`, `v2`
```yml
GET messages
Amount:         <MAX. AMOUNT (-1 to get all) = 20>
Before:         <UTC-TIMESTAMP = -1>
After:          <UTC-TIMESTAMP = -1>
```

> Versions: `v0`, `v1`, `v2`

> Status: 200

      "content": "<MESSAGE CONTENT>",

        "name": "<AUTHOR NAME>"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## ID
The IDs used in the messenger.

### ID Technical
- unsigned 64 bit integer

| Field           | Timestamp (UTC)                                  | Type                          | Increment                        |
|:----------------|:-------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
| **Binary**      | 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 | 00000                         | 00000000000                      |
| **Bits**        | 63 to 15                                         | 15 to 11                      | 11 to 0                          |
| **Total Bits**  | 48                                               | 5                             | 11                               |
| **Description** | ms since `EPOCH`                                 | the type (message, user, ...) | increment to prevent doubled IDs |
| **Retrieval**   | ( `ID` >> 15 ) + `EPOCH`                         | (`ID` & F800 ) >> 0x1F        | `ID` & 0x7FF                     |

The above-mentioned `EPOCH` is `1609455600000` (UNIX timestamp from *`01/01/2021 00:00`*)
